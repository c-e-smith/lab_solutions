# 1.05 Solution Code

### STEP 1: Cleaning the Data

1. What is the likeliest primary key?
Query: N/A
Answer: PassengerID
Rationale: PassengerID is unique.

2. Which column has the most NULL values? How many cells in that column are empty?
Query: 
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE PassengerID IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE Survived IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE Pclass IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE Name IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE Age IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE SibSp IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE Parch IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE Ticket IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE Fare IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE Cabin IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE Embarked IS NULL;
```
Answer: Cabin, 687

3. Delete all rows where Embarked is empty, as we'll assume these individuals did not get on the ship.
Query: 
```sql
DELETE FROM titanic WHERE Embarked IS NULL;
```
Answer: N/A
Rationale: N/A

(As a pratical note, we should check to see if the query worked properly. If I run ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic;```, I should see 889 values now - and I do!)

4. Fill all empty cabins with ¯\(ツ)/¯.

Query:
```sql
UPDATE titanic SET cabin = '¯\(ツ)/¯' WHERE cabin IS NULL;
```
Answer: N/A
Rationale: N/A

(As a pratical note, we should check to see if the query worked properly. If I run ```sql SELECT * FROM titanic;```, I should see ¯\(ツ)/¯ in the Cabin column - and I do!)

### STEP 2: Feature Extraction

1. There are two columns that pertain to how many family members are on the boat for a given person. Create a new column called FamilyCount which will be the sum of those two columns.
Query:
```sql
ALTER TABLE titanic ADD COLUMN FamilyCount INTEGER;
UPDATE titanic SET FamilyCount = SibSp + Parch;
```
Answer: N/A
Rationale: N/A

2. Create new dummy variables:

2-1. Reverends have a special title in their name, "Rev." Create a column called IsReverend: 1 if they're a reverend, 0 if they're not.

Query:
```sql
ALTER TABLE titanic ADD COLUMN IsReverend INTEGER;
UPDATE titanic SET IsReverend = 0;
UPDATE titanic SET IsReverend = 1 WHERE name LIKE '%Rev%';
```
Answer: N/A
Rationale: We can create dummy variables by creating a column of all 0s, then setting rows that meet a particular condition to 1.

2-2. Create 3 columns: Embarked_C, Embarked_Q and Embarked_S. These columns will have 1's and 0's that correspond to the C, Q and S values in the Embarked column.
Query:
```sql
ALTER TABLE titanic ADD COLUMN Embarked_C INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE titanic ADD COLUMN Embarked_Q INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE titanic ADD COLUMN Embarked_S INTEGER;
UPDATE titanic SET Embarked_C = 0;
UPDATE titanic SET Embarked_Q = 0;
UPDATE titanic SET Embarked_S = 0;
UPDATE titanic SET Embarked_C = 1 WHERE Embarked = 'C';
UPDATE titanic SET Embarked_Q = 1 WHERE Embarked = 'Q';
UPDATE titanic SET Embarked_S = 1 - Embarked_C - Embarked_Q;
```
Answer: N/A
Rationale: SQLite requires us to add these columns one at a time, whereas we can do this more efficiently in PostgreSQL later! If the last query (setting Embarked_S = 1) is confusing, work through it to convince yourself why it works! (This only works if Embarked only takes on values S, C, and Q, and there are no nulls!)

2-3. Create 2 columns: M and F. Create dummy variables for Sex.
Query:
```sql
ALTER TABLE titanic ADD COLUMN M INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE titanic ADD COLUMN F INTEGER;
UPDATE titanic SET M = 0;
UPDATE titanic SET F = 0;
UPDATE titanic SET M = 1 WHERE Sex = 'male';
UPDATE titanic SET F = 1 - M;
```
Answer: N/A
Rationale: N/A

### STEP 3: Exploratory Analysis

1. What is the total number of individuals on the ship?
Query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic;
```
Answer: 889
Rationale: There are 889 individuals in the passenger manifest who did embark on the ship.

2-1. What was the survival rate overall?
Query:
```sql
SELECT SUM(Survived) / 889 FROM titanic;
```
Answer: The answer here is 0, which is weird.
Rationale:

2-2. Hmm. The answer to 2-1 seems weird. Try this:
Query:
```sql
SELECT SUM(Survived) / 889.0 FROM titanic;
```
Answer: The answer here is about 38.25%. Much better!
Rationale: See below.

2-3.
Query: N/A
Answer: The difference between 2-1. and 2-2. is that in 2-2., we divided an integer by a float (in SQL, called a `REAL`, as in real number), so our result was a float. Dividing an integer by an integer yields an integer, which is usually not what we want. We'll want to be careful to divide integers by floats if we want our result to be in the form of a float!
Rationale: N/A

2-4.
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived) FROM titanic;
```
Answer: We got the same thing as 2-2.
Rationale: Looks like the `AVG` function is going to take care of the integer/float issue.

3-1. What was the survival rate of men?
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived), Sex FROM titanic GROUP BY Sex;
```
Answer: 18.89%
Rationale: The query pulls the survival rate for both men and women, but 18.89% refers to the survival rate of men.

3-2. What was the survival rate of women? Answer this using WHERE.
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived) FROM titanic WHERE Sex = 'female';
```
Answer: 74.04%
Rationale: Our answer from 3-1. would also generate the same answer, but here we use `WHERE` to get the result.

3-3. What was the survival rate of men? Answer this using the Sex dummy variables that you created in step 2.
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived) FROM titanic WHERE M = 1;
```
Answer: 18.89%
Rationale: This matches the answer above!

3-4. What was the survival rate of women? Answer this using the Sex dummy variables that you created in step 2.
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived),M,F FROM titanic GROUP BY M,F;
```
Answer: 74.04%, as expected!
Rationale: This query returns the survival rate for men and women.

4. What was the survival rate for each Pclass?
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived),Pclass FROM titanic GROUP BY Pclass ORDER BY Pclass;
```
Answer: 62.62% from Pclass 1, 47.28% from Pclass 2, and 24.24% from Pclass 3.
Rationale: N/A

5. Did any reverends survive? How many?
Query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM titanic WHERE Survived = 1 AND IsReverend = 1;
```
Answer: Yes, 1.
Rationale: N/A

6. How many unique fares are there?
Query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Fare) FROM titanic;
```
Answer: 247
Rationale: N/A

7. What is the range of fares?
Query:
```sql
SELECT MAX(Fare), MIN(Fare) FROM titanic;
```
Answer: 93.5
Rationale: Range = Max - Min = 93.5 - 0 = 93.5

Note: The "right" answer is 512.3292, but the column is typecast as TEXT, so sorting by values isn't available without creating a new column. In order to do that, you could run the following:

```sql
ALTER TABLE titanic ADD COLUMN fare_numeric REAL;
UPDATE titanic SET fare_numeric = fare;
SELECT MAX(fare_numeric) - MIN(fare_numeric) FROM titanic;
```

However, there isn't the expectation that you transform the column type.

8. Alphabetically, what are the last five names in the passenger manifest among people who are in Pclass 1?
Query:
```sql
SELECT Name FROM titanic WHERE Pclass = 1 ORDER BY Name DESC;
```
Answer: Young, Wright, Woolner, Williams-Lambert, Williams
Rationale: N/A

9. What is the survival rate for cabins marked `¯\(ツ)/¯`?
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived) FROM titanic WHERE Cabin = "¯\(ツ)/¯";
```
Answer: 29.99%
Rationale: N/A

10. What is the survival rate for people whose Age is missing?
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived) FROM titanic WHERE Age IS NULL;
```
Answer: 29.38%.
Rationale: N/A

11. What is the survival rate for each port of embarkation? Answer using a GROUP BY statement.
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived),Embarked FROM titanic GROUP BY Embarked ORDER BY Embarked;
```
Answer: C: 55.36%, Q: 38.96%, S: 33.70%.
Rationale: N/A

12. What is the survival rate for children (under 12) in each Pclass?
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived),Pclass FROM titanic WHERE AGE < 12 GROUP BY PClass ORDER BY PClass;
```
Answer: PClass 1: 100%, PClass 2: 100%, PClass 3: 46.15%.
Rationale:

13. Did the captain of the ship survive? Is he on the list?
Query:
```sql
SELECT Name,Survived FROM titanic WHERE Name LIKE '%Cap%';
```
Answer: Assuming that "Capt." refers to the captain of the ship, Captain Edward Gifford Crosby was on the list and did not survive. (A Google search implies that Crosby was the captain.)
Rationale: N/A

14. Of all the people that died, who had the most expensive ticket? How much did it cost?
Query:
```sql
SELECT MAX(Fare) FROM titanic WHERE Survived = 0;
SELECT MAX(fare_numeric) FROM titanic WHERE Survived = 0;
```
Answer: The correct answer is $263, but we'll accept $90 or $263 depending on whether you created the numeric column for "Fare."
Rationale: N/A

15. Does having family on the boat help or hurt your chances of survival?
Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(Survived),FamilyCount FROM titanic GROUP BY FamilyCount > 0;
```
Answer: Having family in the boat seemed to increase your chances of survival.
Rationale: The "GROUP BY FamilyCount > 0" is a condition that groups observations by whether or not their FamilyCount was 0. (In effect, this groups observations by whether or not family were present on the Titanic.)
